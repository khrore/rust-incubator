# Rust Incubator

> It wasnâ€™t always so clear, but the Rust programming language is fundamentally about _empowerment_: no matter what kind of code you are writing now, Rust empowers you to reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains than you did before.
> _<div align="right">Rust Book's Foreword</div>_

This project represents a hard-way step-by-step [Rust] learning course from language basics to a capability of web backend development.

## Prerequisites

### Toolchain

- [rustup] for installing the [Rust] toolchain and keeping it up-to-date.
- [CLion]/[IntelliJ IDEA] + [IntelliJ Rust] + [Toml][intellij toml] plugins as the development environment (or any other of your choice).

### Bookshelf

- [Rust Book] teaches and explains [Rust] basics.
- [Rust By Example] teaches you [Rust] basics using editable examples.
- [Rust Reference] is not a formal spec, but is more detailed and comprehensive than the [Rust Book].
- [Cheats.rs] and [Rust SVG Cheatsheet] for quick reference.
- [Rust Edition Guide] for considering the improvements in [Rust 2018] and [Rust 2021].
- [Rust std lib] documentation.
- [Cargo Book] is a guide to [Cargo], [Rust]'s build tool and dependency manager.
- [Rustdoc Book] is a guide to the `rustdoc` documentation tool.
- [Rust Cookbook] is a collection of simple examples that demonstrate good practices to accomplish common programming tasks, using crates from the [Rust] ecosystem.
- [Rust Design Patterns] is an open source repository of [Rust] design patterns and idioms.
- [Effective Rust] is a collection of guidelines that had been learned from real world experience of creating software in [Rust].
- [Rust API Guidelines] is a set of recommendations on how to design and present APIs for [Rust].
- [Rust FAQ] answers common questions about [Rust].
- [Rust Playground] allows sharing and checking runnable [Rust] code snippets online.
- [Awesome Rust] is a curated list of [Rust] code and resources.
- [This Week in Rust] represents handpicked and subscribable [Rust] weekly updates.
- [Baby Steps] blog by [Nicholas Matsakis](https://github.com/nikomatsakis) shares useful [Rust] patterns, ideas and design decisions.
- [Learning Material for Idiomatic Rust] is a curated list of resources to help you write ergonomic and idiomatic [Rust] code.

## Steps

### Before you start

[Create][1] a new [GitHub repository] for yourself using this one [as a template][11].

> __NOTE__: __This learning course is constantly improving and evolving over time.__
>
> To be up-to-date with the recent changes in your own copy of this repository, attach the upstream history with the following commands:
>
> ```bash
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/instrumentisto/rust-incubator.git
> git fetch upstream main
> git merge upstream/main --allow-unrelated-histories
> ```
>
> And then, whenever you want to grab some new changes, do the following:
>
> ```bash
> git fetch upstream main
> git merge upstream/main
> ```
>
> Additionally, to be aware about new changes, you may either [watch this repository on GitHub][2], or even track it via [RSS subscription].

### Schedule

Each step must be performed as a separate [PR (pull request)][pr] with an appropriate name and check-marked here in the README's schedule after completion. Each step is a [Cargo workspace member][13], so you can run/test it from the project root (i.e. `cargo run -p step_1_8`). __Consider using [rustfmt] and [Clippy] when you're writing [Rust] code.__
